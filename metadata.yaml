summary: '"The Strange Career of the Chevalier D''Eon de Beaumont: Minister Plenipotentiary
  from France to Great Britain in 1763" by Captain J. Buchan Telfer is a historical
  account written in the late 19th century. The book explores the life of the Chevalier
  D''Eon, a prominent figure in 18th-century France whose ambiguous gender identity
  and roles as a diplomat and spy during intense political times create a fascinating
  narrative. The main focus is on D''Eon''s unique career, including his secret correspondence
  for Louis XV and significant interactions within European courts.  The opening of
  the account provides a detailed preface about Louis XV''s secret correspondence
  and reveals D''Eon''s early years, background, and training. Telfer sets the stage
  by discussing D''Eon''s role as a secret agent for the King and foreshadows the
  extraordinary life awaiting the Chevalier. The narrative portrays D''Eon as a complex
  individual navigating a world that often constrained personal identity within rigid
  societal norms while simultaneously serving as an influential player in the geopolitical
  landscape of his time. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
